# New York City Yellow Taxi Data Analysis

## Objective
In this case study, you will be learning exploratory data analysis (EDA) with the help of a dataset on yellow taxi rides in New York City. This will enable you to understand why EDA is an important step in the process of data science and machine learning.

## Problem Statement
As an analyst at an upcoming taxi operation in NYC, you are tasked to use the 2023 taxi trip data to uncover insights that could help optimize taxi operations. The goal is to analyze patterns in the data that can inform strategic decisions to improve service efficiency, maximize revenue, and enhance passenger experience.

## Data Understanding
The yellow taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.

The data is stored in Parquet format (*.parquet*). The dataset is from 2009 to 2024. However, for this assignment, we will only be using the data from 2023.

The data for each month is present in a different parquet file. You will get twelve files for each of the months in 2023.

The data was collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers like vendors and taxi hailing apps.

| RateCodeID             | The final rate code in effect at the end of the trip.                       |
| Store_and_fwd_flag     | This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory.     |
| Payment_type           | A numeric code signifying how the passenger paid for the trip.              |
| Fare_amount            | The time-and-distance fare calculated by the meter.                         |
| Extra                  | Miscellaneous extras and surcharges.                                        |

| Tolls_amount           | Total amount of all tolls paid in trip.                                     |
| Total_amount           | The total amount charged to passengers.                                     |
| Congestion_Surcharge   | Total amount collected in trip for NYS congestion surcharge.                |
| Airport_fee            | 1.25 USD for pick up only at LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy Airports.        |

### Taxi Zones
Each of the trip records contains a field corresponding to the location of the pickup or drop-off of the trip, populated by numbers ranging from 1-263. These numbers correspond to taxi zones, which may be downloaded as a table or map/shapefile and matched to the trip records using a join.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
